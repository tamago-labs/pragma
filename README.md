# Pragma : A Decentralized Vector Query, Indexing and Storage Protocol 

![Image](https://img.tamago.finance/Pragma.png)

Pragma is a decentralized vector database built on FVM, employing Merkle tree proof to synchronize off-chain vector data with the state on-chain. It allows the leveraging of AI models to generate knowledge and facts, serving the needs of your community, 

For example, we can upload the chat history from the Telegram Web3 project group chat. We can then ask questions based on the conversation that has already been discussed.

## How To Use

To explore, we have a Bitcoin whitepaper collection where we have uploaded 1/3 of the Bitcoin whitepaper into the vector database. You can navigate to the query section and ask questions like 'What is proof of work?'

There are three pre-defined query operations that we can test. However, in the long run, we will provide an SDK that allows developers to build AI applications and point to the retrieval URL that wraps around the vector information.
