Pragma is a decentralized vector database built on FVM, employing Merkle tree proof to synchronize off-chain vector data with the state on-chain. It allows the leveraging of AI models to generate knowledge and facts, serving the needs of your community, for example, in the video demo, we show how to upload the chat history from the Telegram Web3 project group chat. We can then ask questions based on the conversation that has already been discussed.Pragma is a decentralized vector database built on FVM, employing Merkle tree proof to synchronize off-chain vector data with the state on-chain.
